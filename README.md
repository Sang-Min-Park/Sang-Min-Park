<h2>💡 About Me</h2>

- 🎓 B.S. in Electronic & Electrical Engineering, **Chung-Ang University (Seoul, Korea)**  
- 🧠 3.5+ years of experience in ASIC RTL design and verification at **LX Semicon (formerly LG Silicon Works)**  
- 🔍 Specialized in **Display Driver IC (DDIC)** 
- 🧩 Proficient in Verilog, with hands-on ATE validation  
- 🌎 Aspiring graduate student in **SoC Design and Hardware Acceleration**  
- 🛠 Interested in **Many-core accelerator design, low-power ASIC systems, and RTL-to-Silicon prototyping**

<h2>🏗 Highlighted Hardware Projects</h2>

- **Brightness Control IP** — Designed and verified LUT-based pixel-to-voltage conversion with  
  brightness/temperature adaptation and Contrast/Offset/Dither/APL(Average Pixel Level)/Peak features (DDIC ASIC)  
- **OTP(One Time Programmable) Memory Controller IP** — Implemented program/load control for reliable NVM operation,  
  validated through ATE vector testing and silicon bring-up.  
- **Power Optimization & Analysis** — Applied computation restructuring and XOR gating, performed PTPX-based power analysis  
- **System & Verification** — Performed **end-to-end RTL verification across the full DDIC datapath**, gaining  
  **system-level insight** from pixel input to output.  
  Collaborated with system engineering, test, and physical desgin teams for silicon validation,  
  MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface) CTS compliance testing, current measurement, and HTOL(Hot Temperature Operation Life) reliability verification, contributing to final product qualification.
