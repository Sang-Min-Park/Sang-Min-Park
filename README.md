<h2>🏗 Highlighted Hardware Projects</h2>

- **Brightness Control IP** — Designed and verified LUT-based pixel-to-voltage conversion with  
  brightness/temperature adaptation and Contrast/Offset/Dither/APL(Average Pixel Level)/Peak features (DDIC ASIC)  
- **OTP(One Time Programmable) Memory Controller IP** — Implemented program/load control for reliable NVM operation,  
  validated through ATE vector testing and silicon bring-up.  
- **Power Optimization & Analysis** — Applied computation restructuring and XOR gating, performed PTPX-based power analysis  
- **System & Verification** — Performed **end-to-end RTL verification across the full DDIC datapath**,<br>
  gaining **system-level insight** from pixel input to output.  
- Collaborated with system engineering, test, and physical design teams for silicon validation,<br>  
  MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface) CTS compliance testing, current measurement,<br>
  and HTOL(Hot Temperature Operation Life) reliability verification, contributing to final product qualification.
